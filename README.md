# Incarceration Data

## Sources

* [Vera Institute Incarceration Trends](https://github.com/vera-institute/incarceration-trends)
* [Prison Policy Initiative: The Geography of Mass Incarceration](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/origin/)
  * Note, that I have not collected the data from the the Prison Policy Initiative, yet. It will require some web scraping because the data is contained in HTML tables, and I do not think there is a way to download the data. It may be worth reaching out to their research team.
