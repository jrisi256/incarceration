  * Note, that I have not collected the data from the the Prison Policy Initiative, yet. It will require some web scraping because the data is contained in HTML tables, and I do not think there is a way to download the data. It may be worth reaching out to their research team.

  * Data and code came from the research team in an email. Full details on the data can be found in their paper as well as in my notes.
