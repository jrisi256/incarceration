# Things to check when harmonizing the State & County health rankings data across years

## Within year

* What does each variable mean? Record the meaning of each variable as well as its source in my **my_dictionary**.
* Which years of data measurement correspond to which years of the State & County Health Rankings data releases? Record that in **year_matching**.
* Does all the documentation agree about the variable meaning, variable source, and years of availability?

## Across years

* Do the data releases have the same names for the same name for the same variables?
* Do the data releases have the same source for the same variable?
* Do the data releases introduce new variables?

## Harmonization

* Changed *chlamydia_rate* in 2010 to *sexually_transmitted_infections* in order to match other years.
* Changed *single-parent_households* in 2010 to *children_in_single-parent_households* in order to match other years.
