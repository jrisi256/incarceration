Tomorrow:
Think about how to make my documentation more streamlined and standardized (e.g., adding columns for numerator and denominator, definition of variable, source of variable, limitations).
Plot data over time and see if there are any jumps in values over time. This is a signal that there was a change in data sources or data measurement which means the variable name should likely change.
Compare my findings what the data providers say are the discontinuities in the data.
Look into documentation for the longitudinal data as well as the main documentation on the website for the latest release of the variables to see how they compare to my definitions as well to generate ideas for how to make my documentation more streamlined (e.g., adding a column for if the variable is age-adjusted).
Compare longitudinal data releases over time to make sure they are consistent (as well as the documentation).
Compare longitudinal data to cross-sectional data to ensure estimates are consistent and come up with a system for marking when they are not consistent.
